XBeeAPIReader
=============

## What

This is a Qt-based testbed for developing some classes and code for reading and decoding ZigBee packets.

## Why

Mostly learning about XBee radios. (I'm using the Digi ones, Series 2.)

## How

Put 'em together (mostly from the "Building Wireless Sensor Networks" book) and try 'em out.
